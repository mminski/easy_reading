This little script extends your reading experience and shows you the word you dont know instantly through you OS notification popups.
All you need to do is running the script and mark or double click a word want to be translated.

You can change the target and source language of your translations by changing the country code in the script in line 11.
To use this feature under OSX, just read line 12.

Additionally all your translations are saved into a file.
