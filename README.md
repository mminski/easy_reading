Reading extension for lifelong language learners

This little script extends your reading experience and shows you the words you dont know instantly through your OS notification popups.
All you need to do is running the script and mark or double click on a word, you want to be translated.

You can change the target and source language of your translations by changing the country code in the script in line 11.
To use this feature under OSX, just read line 12.

Additionally all your translations are saved into a file.
